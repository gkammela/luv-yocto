I. Adding the meta-luv layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the meta-luv layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the meta-luv layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-luv \
    "

Then it is necessary to specify the luv distribution in local.conf.
e.g.:

  DISTRO = "luv"


II. Executing ACPI NFIT destructive tests
=================================================

The NDCTL test suite includes a batch of destructive tests. These are
disabled by default. If the user wants to execute these destructive
tests, the luv.nfit-destructive option needs to be passed as a kernel
parameter. This can be done by adding this option to the grub linux
command that loads the Linux kernel. The file to implement this change
is EFI/BOOT/grub.cfg located in the bootable partition of the LUV
media.
